                <h2>Life without recaptcha</h2>
                <p>The concept behind this website is to focus on the aspect of involuntarily being shown media, propaganda, and digital spam on the internet. I’m imagining the aesthetics of the site to draw from the 90’s desktop style with this idea of mail spam while showing these issues of the internet. I see the idea of having spam folders that when you open it is will show different problematic propaganda or just brain rot content that is often seen on TikTok</p>

                    <h2>Unsupervised Internet Access</h2>
                    <p>The foundation for this project comes from my experience with unsupervised internet access in the early 2000’s. During this time the internet was wildy different than it is now, it was extremely unfiltered. With this idea, I can imagine scrolling through different internet UI like 4chan to represent that era. </p>

                    <h2>Overloading the Internet</h2>
                    <p>This website project would focus on the fact that the internet is overflowing with information, recently more now than ever. We are seeing more and more web pages, Instagram stories and archives being slowly deleted. For this project I’d want to focus on the impermanence of the internet but also how easily something can be truly removed from existence despite what we’ve been told about the internet being forever. </p>

                    <h2>Liminal Web: <em>Exploring the Uncanny Valleys of the Internet</em></h2>
                    <p>A dreamy, liminal-space aesthetic site where users navigate abandoned digital places (empty game servers, quiet livestreams, outdated homepages). This concept could include elements of nostalgia such as dial-up internet sounds that lean into the uncanny valley aspect. It could include web folklore, like the Creepy Pastas, Backrooms or other internet mysteries. </p>

                    <h2>Vanishing Point: <em>A Browser That Slowly Deletes Itself</em></h2>
                    <p>This concept focuses on a website that erases its content over time. Every time a person lands on the website, it speeds up the process of decay. Visitors can try to save pieces of information but can never save the whole website. I feel that this concept is not only symbolic of the impermanence of the web but also creates a sort of critic of democracy as someone can choose to not save something you did to save your information. To further this concept the content of this webpage could be self-uploaded, like a forum, this would make the users face the uncomfortable reality that you cannot save everything. </p>
