      <h1>Inspiration & Styles</h1>
            <p>For the design of this site, I was very inspired by the retro UI design trends also because it reminds us of a time when these issues weren't as prevalent. There were a few websites in particular that really inspired the design: <a href="https://www.ordinaryholdings.com/" target="_blank">Ordinary Holdings</a> & <a href="https://tdingsun.github.io/reading-machines/" target="_blank">Reading Machines.</a> The website Reading Machines was particularly interesting because of the way they use sound and type to explore the ways we interact with type. While I didn't push it to the extreme it encouraged me to design a forum that was less-convectional.</p>
